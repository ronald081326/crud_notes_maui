NET MAUI CRUD App with Entity Framework Core and SQLite

This is a simple .NET MAUI application that demonstrates how to build a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface using Entity Framework Core with SQLite as the local database. The project is meant as a starter template for learning how data access, MVVM, navigation, and UI binding work inside a .NET MAUI app.
